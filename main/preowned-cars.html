                    A used car can be a great way to get a lot of bang for your buck on your next car. New cars are great, but used cars offer big financial advantages thanks to depreciation. 
                    The average car loses 35 percent of its value in the first three years of its life which is great news for drivers shopping for a good deal on the used market.

                <p class="mb-0 ps-5">
                    <b>Pros:</b> The biggest pro of buying a used car is value. Like we mentioned earlier, a used car can lose a lot of its value in not a lot of time.
                     If you really keep an eye out for which cars depreciate the fastest, it's possible to get a used car that's as little as three years old for less than half the price that is was when it was new.

                    <b>Cons:</b> There are always some gambles that come with buying a used car. 
                    If you buy a used car from a dealer, it's likely gone through some kind of inspection by professionals to ensure it doesn't have any major problems. 
                    If you're buying from a private party, however, you're taking a bigger risk and there might be some hidden problems that you could miss no matter how hard you look it over. 
                    Consider getting a pre-purchase inspection done by a mechanic before agreeing to buy a used car from a private seller.
